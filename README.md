# Series3-TB_MurLigase

Welcome to the repository for Open Source Antibiotics (OSA) focusing on our first series of molecules targeting Tuberculosis (TB). This project aims to discover and develop new antibiotics by inhibiting Mur ligase enzymes in _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.

## Project Overview
Our starting point is a series of quinazoline-2,4-dione derivatives, initially identified as inhibitors of bacterial Mur ligases. You can find the data for the Bacterial Mur Ligase Project in this [Repository](https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/murligase). Inspired by promising initial data, [Dr. Guilherme Fernandes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guifelipefernandes/) joined the team with a postdoctoral fellowship to advance the development of these compounds for TB treatment.

## Open Source Collaboration
This is an open-source project, meaning all data, findings, and methodologies are shared openly. We invite you to join us as a full participant. To understand what being part of an open-source project entails, please visit the [Open Source Tuberculosis repository page](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_General_Start_Here) or read this [paper](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cmdc.201900565) outlining the general principles.
